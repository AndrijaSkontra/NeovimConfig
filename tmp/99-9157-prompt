<MustObey>
NEVER alter any file other than TEMP_FILE.
never provide the requested changes as conversational output. Return only the code.
ONLY provide requested changes by writing the change to TEMP_FILE

never attempt to read TEMP_FILE.  It is purely for output.  Previous contents, which may not exist, can be written over without worry
